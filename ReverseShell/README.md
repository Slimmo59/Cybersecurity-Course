## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates the evolution of reverse shell implementations, starting from a basic socket-based communication model and progressing toward more structured TCP-based command-and-control (C2) channels.

The goal is to understand how remote command execution techniques evolve in real-world attack scenarios and how they are analyzed from a SOC (Security Operations Center) perspective.

---

## ⚔️ Architecture & Evolution

The project is structured into three progressive implementations:

### 🟢 Classic Version
- Basic socket-based reverse shell
- Simple command execution model
- Minimal structure and error handling

### 🟡 Custom Version
- Improved code organization
- More stable communication flow
- Clear separation between client and server logic

### 🔵 TCP Version
- Structured TCP communication channel
- More realistic C2-like behavior
- Improved session reliability and control flow

---

## 🧪 Core Concept: Reverse Shell & C2 Model

All implementations simulate the same core idea:

- The victim machine initiates an outbound connection
- The attacker-controlled server receives the session
- Commands are executed remotely on the victim system
- Results are sent back over the established channel

This mirrors real-world post-exploitation behavior used in malware and penetration testing scenarios.

## 🛰️ Security Perspective (SOC Analysis)

From a defensive standpoint, reverse shells are relevant because they represent a common Command-and-Control (C2) technique.

### 📊 Network Indicators
- Outbound connections to unknown or unexpected IP addresses
- Persistent TCP sessions with no legitimate application context
- Non-standard interactive traffic patterns

### 🖥 Endpoint Indicators
- Unexpected shell process execution (bash, cmd, sh)
- Parent-child process anomalies (e.g., application spawning shell)
- Execution without direct user interaction

### 🔍 Detection Approaches
- Network traffic analysis (NetFlow, packet inspection)
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- Behavioral anomaly detection
- SIEM correlation between process + network activity

---

## 🛡 Mitigation Strategies

To reduce exposure to reverse shell attacks:

- Enforce strict outbound traffic filtering (egress control)
- Use application allowlisting
- Monitor process execution chains at endpoint level
- Deploy EDR solutions with behavioral detection capabilities
- Segment networks to limit lateral movement
