# Python-Based Reverse Shell Simulation
This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a Reverse Shell (client-server architecture), developed for educational purposes 
to demonstrate how remote command execution and network socket communication function in a cybersecurity context.

---

# 🔍 Overview
A Reverse Shell is a technique where the target machine initiates a connection back to the attacker's listener server. 
This approach is often more effective than a bind shell because it can bypass most inbound firewall rules and Network Address Translation (NAT)
configurations, as the traffic appears to the firewall as an outbound connection.

# 🛠 Features
- **Reliable Data Framing:** Implements a custom protocol using a 4-byte length prefix (big-endian) to ensure complete message reconstruction and prevent
- data fragmentation over TCP.

- **Persistent Connection:** The client features an automatic reconnection mechanism with exponential backoff, ensuring the shell attempts to restore
the link if the server goes offline.

- **Multi-threaded Listener:** The server uses the threading library to handle multiple incoming connections simultaneously without blocking the main interface.

- **Integrated Directory Navigation:** Unlike standard subprocess calls, this implementation handles the cd command internally to maintain the state of the current working directory.

- **Dynamic Configuration:** Both scripts prompt the user for IP addresses and ports at runtime, allowing for flexible deployment in different lab environments.

# 🚀 Lab Setup & Usage

- *Prerequisites*

Operating System: Linux, Windows, or macOS (Python 3.x installed).

Network: Both machines must be able to reach each other over the network.

Libraries: Standard library only (no external pip installations required).

- *Execution*
Start the Listener (Server).

Run this on the "Attacker" machine first:

`bash python3 reverse_shell_server.py`

Enter the IP address to bind to (e.g., 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces).The server will wait on port 8000 by default.

- *Start the Client (Target)* 

Run this on the "Victim" machine:

`bash python3 reverse_shell_client.py`

Enter the Server's IP address and the port (8000).

- *Command Execution*
Once the prompt [IP address]$ appears on the server, type any system command (e.g., ls, whoami, ipconfig) to see the output from the remote machine.
Type exit to close the session.

# 🧠 Educational Objectives
This experiment was conducted to understand:

- Socket Programming: How TCP/IP connections are established, maintained, and closed using the socket library.

- Data Serialization: The use of the struct module to pack and unpack binary data for network transmission.

- Process Management: How the subprocess module interacts with the OS shell to execute commands and capture output.

- Defensive Security: Understanding why EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) systems flag unencrypted reverse shells and the importance of monitoring outbound traffic.
