# Python File Encryption Suite
A lightweight, secure file encryption and decryption utility based on the Fernet (symmetric encryption) standard. This suite allows you to generate a secure key, encrypt all files within a target directory, and safely restore them.

---

# 🛠 Features
- **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses the cryptography library's Fernet implementation (AES-128 in CBC mode with HMAC authentication).

- **Batch Processing:** Automatically scans a specified directory to encrypt or decrypt all files at once.

- **Security:** Ensures that encrypted data cannot be read or modified without the specific 32-byte base64-encoded key.

---

# 📂 File Structure
*gen_key.py:*

- Generates a unique, secure binary key.

*encrypt.py:*

- Uses the key to transform plaintext files into ciphertext.

*decript.py:*

- Reverts ciphertext files back to their original state using the same key.

# 🚀 Getting Started

*Prerequisites*

You must have the cryptography library installed:

`pip install cryptography`

- Generate a Key

First, create your unique encryption key. This will generate a file named key.txt.

`python3 gen_key.py`

**Warning: Never share your key.txt. If you lose this file, you lose access to your encrypted data forever.**

- Encrypt Files

Place the files you wish to protect in a folder named targets. Then run:

`python3 encrypt.py`

The script will read key.txt and overwrite all files in the targets directory with encrypted versions.

- Decrypt Files

To restore your files to their original state:

`python3 decript.py`

The script will use key.txt to verify and decrypt the files. If the key is incorrect or the files are corrupted, the process will fail to prevent data damage.

# ⚠️ Security Disclaimer
This project is for educational and personal use.

Key Loss: There is no "password recovery" mechanism. No key = No data.

Overwriting: The scripts overwrite the original files during the process. It is highly recommended to keep a backup of your data before encrypting.
