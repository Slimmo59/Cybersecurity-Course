# Python MAC Address Changer
A lightweight, robust Python utility designed for Linux systems to modify the Media Access Control (MAC) address of network interfaces using the iproute2 suite.

---

# 🌟 Features
- Automatic Interface Management: Automatically handles bringing the interface down and up to apply changes.

- Validation: Built-in Regex validation to ensure the new MAC address follows the XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX format.

- Verification: Performs a post-execution check to confirm the system has successfully applied the new hardware address.

- Safety First: Includes comprehensive error handling for missing permissions (root), invalid interfaces, or missing system dependencies.

---

# 🚀 Installation & Requirements
- Operating System: Linux (requires the ip command, usually part of the iproute2 package).

- Privileges: Must be run with root/sudo privileges to modify hardware settings.

- Python: Compatible with Python 3.6+.

No external Python libraries are required (uses standard libraries: re, subprocess, sys).

---

# 🛠 Usage
- Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mac-changer.git
cd mac-changer

- Configure the script:
Open change_mac.py and edit the constants at the top:

INTERFACE = "eth0"                 # Your target interface
NEW_MAC   = "00:11:22:33:44:58"    # Your desired MAC

- Run with sudo:

`sudo python3 change_mac.py`

---

# 🔍 How it works
The script follows a standard 4-step networking procedure:

Scan: Retrieves and displays the current MAC address.

Disable: Shuts down the target interface (ip link set <iface> down).

Modify: Changes the hardware address (ip link set <iface> address <mac>).

Enable: Brings the interface back online (ip link set <iface> up).
