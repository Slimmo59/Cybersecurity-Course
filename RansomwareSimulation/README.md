# Remote Ransomware Simulation Lab (Educational PoC)
This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to demonstrate the technical mechanics of a remote encryption attack, 
commonly associated with ransomware. The project is strictly intended for educational purposes, helping students and cybersecurity 
enthusiasts understand Command & Control (C2) communication and symmetric file encryption.

---

# 🎓 Educational Objectives
The goal of this lab is to explore:

- **Command & Control (C2) Logic:** How an attacker sends remote instructions to a compromised node.

- **Symmetric Encryption:** Utilizing the Fernet (AES-based) implementation to secure or lock files.

- **Network Sockets:** Managing persistent connections and multi-threaded request handling in Python.

- **Post-Exploitation Artifacts:** The creation of "ransom notes" as a triggered event after encryption.

# 🛠️ Project Components

### 1. The Controller (controller.py)
This script acts as the Attacker's Terminal. It is responsible for:

* Generating a unique session key for encryption.

* Establishing a TCP connection to the target machine.

* Providing an interactive menu to trigger encryption or decryption remotely.

### 2. The Victim Node (victim.py)
This script represents the Target System. It stays in listening mode and:

* Accepts incoming connections from the Controller.

* Uses multi-threading to handle commands without interrupting its main loop.

* Recursively crawls through specified directories to encrypt or decrypt files.

* Automatically generates or removes a HACKED.txt note.

# 🚀 Lab Setup & Execution

### *Prerequisites*

Python 3.x

cryptography library installed on both nodes:

`pip install cryptography`

- ### Step 1: Start the Victim Node

Run this on the "target" machine (e.g., a Lubuntu VM):

`python3 victim.py`

The node will start listening on port 8080.

- ### Step 2: Connect via Controller

Run this on the "attacker" machine (e.g., Kali Linux):

`python3 controller.py`

Enter the IP address of the Victim Node.

Choose Option 1 to encrypt a directory. You will need to provide the full path on the victim's machine.

Check the victim's folder: all files (except the note) will be encrypted, and HACKED.txt will appear.

Choose Option 2 to decrypt and restore the files.
