# Network Discovery & ARP Scanner (Scapy-based)
This Python script is a high-performance network reconnaissance tool designed to discover active hosts within a Local Area Network (LAN). It utilizes the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to map IP addresses to their respective hardware (MAC) addresses.

# 🔍 How It Works
Unlike standard scanners that rely on ICMP (Ping), which is often blocked by modern firewalls and host-based security software, this tool operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).

- **Frame Construction:** The script crafts a custom Ethernet frame with a broadcast destination address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff).

- **ARP Encapsulation:** It embeds an ARP "who-has" request (Opcode 1) inside the Ethernet frame for every IP in the target range.

- **Broadcast Emission:** The frames are sent across the network segment.

- **Response Parsing:** It captures ARP "is-at" replies (Opcode 2). Since ARP is essential for local communication, active hosts will respond with their MAC address even if they are configured to ignore pings.

# 🛠 Features

**CIDR Support:** Scan entire subnets (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) or specific IP ranges.

**Interface Selection:** Choose the specific network interface (eth0, wlan0, etc.) for the scan.

**Custom Timeouts:** Adjustable wait times for responses to balance speed and accuracy.

**Dynamic Interface Validation:** Automatically checks if the specified network interface exists on the host system.

**Formatted Output:** Clear mapping of IP Address -> MAC Address.
